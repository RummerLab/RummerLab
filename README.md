# Welcome to RummerLab! 🌊🐟

## About Us  
RummerLab is dedicated to understanding how fish, particularly those on coral reefs, adapt to environmental stressors such as rising temperatures and ocean deoxygenation. Our research focuses on **physiology, ecology, and evolution**, with a strong emphasis on **conservation and climate change resilience**.

We are based at James Cook University (Townsville, Australia), and our work spans across global marine ecosystems. From the Great Barrier Reef to the Arctic, our team investigates how fish cope with environmental challenges, with a special focus on **oxygen transport, thermal tolerance, and stress physiology**.

## Our Research  
🔬 **Physiology & Evolution** – Exploring how fish have evolved to thrive in diverse environments.  
🌡️ **Climate Change Impacts** – Studying how rising temperatures and deoxygenation affect marine life.  
🦈 **Sharks & Rays** – Understanding how elasmobranchs (like epaulette sharks) respond to changing oceans.
